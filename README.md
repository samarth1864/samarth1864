## About Me

I started my journey as an architect, where I learned how design shapes the way people live. Over time, my focus shifted to urban planning, understanding how cities grow, interact, and evolve. I then worked in the real estate sector, where I saw how data often drives decisions on land, investment, and development.

This led me to explore artificial intelligence and its potential to make sense of complex human and urban systems. Today, I work at the intersection of AI, urban morphology, and human behavior. I use data and technology to better understand cities, predict environmental risks, and create more informed planning tools.

## Areas of Interest

- Urban data analysis and simulation  
- Human behavior and mobility patterns  
- Environmental prediction using AI  
- Nature-based solutions for climate resilience  
- Participatory urban planning and civic tech  
- Real estate trends and urban form analysis

## Tools and Technologies

Python, QGIS, Rhino, Grasshopper, OpenCV, Google Earth Engine, GAMA, Unity, Reinforcement Learning, NSGA-II, MESA

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to collaborations on AI, urban planning, or sustainable city solutions.
